## 🙋‍♂️ What's Over Here?
 
- Plenty of *Bashful (understandably blushy)* shells ~~waiting to be noticed~~
- Solutions to interview problems and exercises  
- A petty attempt to promote the fun of shell scripting 🤞
- _Generator scripts_ (that initializes the test environment to solve the corresponding problem)
- A constant reminder to myself that I don't need to reinvent the wheel everytime I rediscover the same issue  

> 📌 Note to self: Remember that ugly script you wrote scratching the head for two hours last week? It's never too late push that over here!

## :briefcase: Pre-requisite

Regardless of the environment you may have, chances are rare that you have to [compile bash from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Installing-Bash.html). A bash shell can be accessed through following means:

- **GNU/Linux based Distros (Preinstalled)**
- **Git Bash for Windows**
- **Online Bash Interpreter**

## ⚒ Usage for Problem Solvers

- Run the `generator.sh` script to create a folder hierarchy of all the problems with a ready for you to tackle! Executing the script will:
    1. create a subdirectory for each of the challenges
    2. create a fresh template file `script.sh` under each of the subdirectories 
  > ⚠ Some of my problem directories contain additional `init.sh` script. Copy that into your corresponding location and run it to generate the test environment for that particular problem

- As a bonus, you'll find additional scripts in few of my solutions. Those are the bash concepts / topics that I discovered / tried out before implementing them on the corresponding solution.

- For better understanding, my personal approach to the problems is enclosed in `function mysolve()`, whereas the intended solution can be found under `function actualsolve()`.
